Directory lout/doc/slides

This directory contains the Lout source of
a set of overhead transparencies entitled
`A Practical Introduction to the Lout
Document Formatting System.'  To format
the transparencies, type

	lout -r2 all > outfile.ps

in this directory.  The -r2 flag causes Lout
to run twice over the document, which is needed
to resolve all cross references.  There should
be no error messages at all after the second run.
A copy of the final outfile.ps is included.
