Printing of program files independently of any document is done by
programs. @RawIndex { programs }
programs.standalone @SubIndex { stand-alone }
standalone.programs @Index { stand-alone programs }
the Unix pipeline
@ID @Code "prg2lout  -l language  options  files  |  lout  -s  >  out.ps"
where @Code language stands for any one of the programming language
names in the first column of the table above.  As usual with Lout, the
output will be a PostScript file.  Each input file will begin on a new
page of the output, starting with its name in bold type.  The @Code options
are
@WideTaggedList
@TI { {@Code-p}{@I style} } {
Select a printing style (Section {@NumberOf embedded}), either
{@Code -pfixed}, {@Code -pvarying}, or {@Code -psymbol}.  The default
value varies with the language, as shown in the fourth column of the
table above.
}
@TI { @Code -n } {
Do not print file names.
}
@TI { {@Code -f}{@I font} } {
Select a font family.  The default is @Code "-fCourier" for
{@Code -pfixed}, and @Code "-fTimes" otherwise.
}
@TI { {@Code -v}{@I vsize} } {
Select an inter-line spacing size in Lout units.  The default is
@Code -v1.1fx meaning 1.1 times the font size measured from baseline
to baseline.
}
@TI { {@Code -b}{@I number} } {
Select a blank line scale factor, usually a number between 0.5 and 1.0,
indicating the factor by which the usual amount of white space inserted
to represent a blank line is to be reduced.  The default is @Code { 1.0 },
meaning no reduction.
}
@TI { {@Code -L}{@I number} } {
Add line numbers to the print, starting with {@I number}, or
1 if {@I number} is omitted.
}
@TI { {@Code -N} } {
Do not print line numbers at the start of blank lines.
}
@TI { {@Code -S}{@I file} } {
Use @I file as the setup file for printing your language.  This allows
you to change all the options mentioned in subsequent sections, rather
than just the few given here.
}
@EndList
There are also {@Code -t} and {@Code -T} options for dealing with tab
characters (Section {@NumberOf tabs}).
