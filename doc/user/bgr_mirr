The @Code "@HMirror" symbol produces a horizontal mirror reflection
reflect. @Index { Reflected objects }
mirror. @Index { Mirror images }
hmirror. @Index @Code "@HMirror"
of the following object:
@ID @Code {
"@HMirror AMBULANCE"
}
produces
@ID @HMirror AMBULANCE
The @Code "@VMirror" symbol produces a vertical mirror reflection
vmirror. @Index @Code "@VMirror"
of the following object:
@ID @Code {
"@VMirror 5c @Wide @Box {"
"@B { Pond life. }  Pond life includes"
"frogs, tadpoles, newts, salamanders,"
"eels, and mosquito larvae."
"}"
}
produces
@ID @VMirror 5c @Wide @Box {
@B { Pond life. }  Pond life includes
frogs, tadpoles, newts, salamanders,
eels, and mosquito larvae.
}
As this example shows, the object to be mirror reflected may be
arbitrary.  We have used a @Code "@Wide" symbol in this example
to restrict the width of the result to be five centimetres wide.
See the description of the @Code "@VShift" symbol in
Section {@NumberOf include} for what to do if your reflected
object is not aligned properly with adjacent objects.
