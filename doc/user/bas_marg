The @Code "@Break" symbol offers a variant of ordinary paragraph
breaking called @I { margin kerning }, in which small characters
margin.kerning. @Index { margin kerning }
that happen to end up at the start or end of a line protrude
slightly into the margin.  This is said to make documents
look better, particularly in narrow columns.  For example,
@ID @Code @Verbatim {
2i @Wide marginkerning @Break {
This is a test, just a little test, of
margin kerning.   It should kern small
characters at the margins.
}
}
produces
@ID 2i @Wide marginkerning @Break {
This is a test, just a little test, of
margin kerning.   It should kern small
characters at the margins.
}
in which the comma at the end of the first line protrudes.  (For the
@Code "@Wide" symbol, which produces a two-inch column here,
see Section {@NumberOf precise}.)
@PP
As with most @Code "@Break" options, you probably want this in your
@Code "@InitialBreak" option, described in Section {@NumberOf paras},
if you use it at all.  By default there is no margin kerning.  To turn
it off in a context where it is on, use @Code {"nomarginkerning @Break"}.
