This chapter explains how to produce mathematics in Lout,
equations. @RawIndex { equations @I see mathematics }
mathematics. @Index mathematics
mathematics.math @SubIndex { @Code "@Math" }
math. @Index { @Code "@Math" (mathematics) }
using the @Code "@Math" symbol
@FootNote {
@Code "@Math" follows the equation formatting rules of D. E. Knuth's
knuth @Index { Knuth, D. E. }
tex. @Index { @TeX }
@TeX system.  Prior to Version 3.37 of Lout, this chapter described
a symbol called
eq. @Index @Code "@Eq"
{@Code "@Eq"} which was similar to {@Code "@Math"} but less faithful
to those rules.  For backward compatibility the @Code "@Eq" symbol
is still available and still works exactly as described in the old
documentation, but there is no reason to use it in new documents.
}
like this:
@ID @Code @Verbatim {
@Math { int from { 0 } to { 1 } dx over sqrt {1 - x sup 2} = pi over 2 }
}
This example produces
@ID @Math { int from { 0 } to { 1 } dx over sqrt {1 - x sup 2} = pi over 2 }
The @Code "@Math" symbol looks after all the details of spacing for
you, and it provides several hundred mathematical symbols.
