The @Code "@HClip" symbol clips the following object horizontally to
the available width:
@ID @Code {
"@Box 1c @Wide @HClip WARNING!"
}
produces
@ID {
@Box 1c @Wide @HClip WARNING!
}
The following object may be arbitrary as usual; for example, it
could be an illustration included using @Code "@IncludeGraphic"
(Section {@NumberOf include}).
@PP
We have used the @Code "@Wide" symbol from Section {@NumberOf precise}
to make clear what the available width is in this small example (one
centimetre), but @Code "@HClip" will work in any context; for example,
you could use it to clip a table entry, or a display.
@PP
The @Code "@HClip" symbol has a @Code "shift" option which determines
which part of the clipped object is displayed.  It may take on any
value between {@Code "0.0"}, meaning to display the leftmost part
(the default value), and {@Code "1.0"}, meaning to display the rightmost
part:
@ID @Code {
"@Box 1c @Wide @HClip shift { 1.0 } WARNING!"
}
produces
@ID {
@Box 1c @Wide @HClip shift { 1.0 } WARNING!
}
To display the central part, use shift value {@Code "0.5"}.  Notice that
there is no unit of measurement attached to the value of {@Code "shift"}.
@PP
There is also a @Code "@VClip" symbol which works in exactly the same
way, only vertically.  The two symbols combine together naturally:
@ID @Code {
"@Box 1c @Wide 0.2c @High @HClip @VClip WARNING!"
}
produces
@ID {
@Box 1c @Wide 0.2c @High @HClip @VClip WARNING!
}
The @Code "shift" options may be used as usual to determine which part of
the two-dimensional area is displayed.
