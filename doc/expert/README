Directory lout/doc/expert

This directory contains the Lout source files for the Expert's Guide
to the Lout Document Formatting System.  To produce the Guide, type
the command

	lout -r4 all > outfile.ps

in this directory.  The -r4 flag causes Lout to run over the document
four times.  This is necessary to completely resolve all cross
references, although a readable PostScript file outfile.ps would
be generated after a single run if -r4 was omitted.  Auxiliary files
with .li and .ld suffixes will be created in this directory.  A copy
of the final outfile.ps is included.  There should be no warning
messages on the fourth run, except this one:

lout file "pre_conc" (from "pre" line 7, from "all" line 25):
   162,1: 13.2c object too high for 8.7c space; will try elsewhere

which just warns about a figure that is not able to be placed on
the first possible page, and so has to appear on the next page.
