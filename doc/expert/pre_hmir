hmirro. @Index { @@HMirror symbol }
vmirro. @Index { @@VMirror symbol }
mirroring @Index { Mirroring an object }
reflecting @Index { Reflecting an object }
@@HMirror and @@VMirror cause their right parameter to be reflected,
either horizontally or vertically.  For example,
@ID @Code {
"@HMirror AMBULANCE"
}
has result
@ID @HMirror AMBULANCE
and
@ID @Code {
"@VMirror AMBULANCE"
}
has result
@ID @VMirror AMBULANCE
The parameters of these symbols may be arbitrary Lout objects as usual.
Both symbols have both a @@OneCol and a @@OneRow effect.
@PP
In each case the reflection is about the mark of the object (that is,
the reflected objects have the same marks as the originals), so that,
for example, when used within a line of text the results are
@HMirror AMBULANCE and @VMirror AMBULANCE respectively.
