These symbols, which are allowed only at the start of a document, tell
Lout that the EPS file named is likely to be included repeatedly:
@ID @Code "@IncludeGraphicRepeated { myportrait.eps }"
To actually see the graphic you use @@IncludeGraphic as usual.  The
purpose of @@IncludeGraphicRepeated is not to display the graphic but
rather to instruct Lout to include its EPS file in the output file just
once, at the start, rather than over and over again for every time it
appears in an @@IncludeGraphic, as would otherwise occur.
@PP
Any number of @@IncludeGraphicRepeated and @@SysIncludeGraphicRepeated
directives may appear at the start of the document.  The files involved
may be compressed as for @@IncludeGraphic.  The file names given within
@@IncludeGraphicRepeated must be identical to the name used within the
corresponding @@IncludeGraphic symbols, or else the @@IncludeGraphicRepeated
will be ineffective.  If @@SysIncludeGraphicRepeated is used (as opposed
to @@IncludeGraphicRepeated) then all corresponding includes must use
@@SysIncludeGraphic rather than @@IncludeGraphic.
@PP
Use of @@IncludeGraphicRepeated does not change the appearance of
the output at all, but, if the EPS file would otherwise be included
many times over, the result will be a much shorter PostScript file
which will usually print significantly faster as well.  However, Lout
uses Level 2 PostScript features to implement @@IncludeGraphicRepeated,
which may not be available in some old printers, and the contents of the
EPS file have to be stored in the printer for the entire duration of the
print job, so there is a risk that memory will run out if
@@IncludeGraphicRepeated is used.
@PP
The implementation of @@IncludeGraphicRepeated uses code given by
the authors of PostScript which employs PostScript forms to save
the EPS files @Cite { $adobe1996epsforms }.  Lout's version of this code
is somewhat modified, partly for simplicity and partly to correct a
possible bug caused by their use of a single filter to read all the
EPS files, rather than a separate filter for each one.
