    *** IMPORTANT: TWO CHANGES THAT ARE NOT UPWARDLY COMPATIBLE ***

    (1)  The @Abstract symbol in technical reports now comes before the
	 // symbol, not after it.  See User's Guide for details.

    (2)  Setup file arrangements have changed.  You now need to have one
	 @SysInclude line for each package you use.  For example,

	    Previous versions           Version 3.13
	    ---------------------------------------------

	    @SysInclude { eq }          @SysInclude { eq }
	    @SysInclude { ddoc }        @SysInclude { diag }
				        @SysInclude { doc }

         Import clauses in mydefs files also have to change:

	    Previous versions           Version 3.13
	    ---------------------------------------------

            import @DocumentLayout      import @BasicSetup
	    import @CPrint              import @CPSetup
	    import @DiagramPrint        import @DiagSetup

         Sorry for the inconvenience, but the old system was inconsistent
	 and was tending towards an unsustainable combinatorial explosion
	 of setup files.  No changes *within* documents are needed, and
	 these new arrangements do not affect the content of the packages.
	 The user's guide documents it all.

Changes and new features introduced in Version 3.14 [released March 1999]

    Bug fixes
    "lout -PDF" now available as alternative to "lout -Z"

    Running headers in multi-page tables
    Running headers in indexes

    Robustness wrt Linux strcoll() improved (tab characters no longer compared)
    "Abstract" word in tech reports now centred again by default
    Lout now builds composite characters - see Expert's Guide, under @Font

    *** IMPORTANT: ONE CHANGE THAT IS NOT UPWARDLY COMPATIBLE ***

    If you are using your own setup file, then it is likely to contain the
    line "@SysInclude { fontdefs }".  There is no longer a fontdefs file,
    there is now a fontdefs database, so you need to replace this line with
    "@SysDatabase @FontDef { fontdefs }".

    I've decided not to maintain the PDF back end, but I will try to ensure
    that Lout's PostScript output works with PostScript-to-PDF converters.

    Arrowheads at opposite ends of a @Diag link now each have own style,
      length, and width (NB this is marginally not upward compatible)
    User's Guide now recommends "paint { none }" to get no paint, although
      the old "nopaint" value is still available for backward compatibility
    Any line anywhere can end in any of \n, \r, \r\n, or \n\r

    Nonpareil and Ruby programming languages supported by prg2lout
    Eight-bit characters considered printable by prg2lout

      plus @GraphDotDashed, @GraphDotDotDashed, @GraphDotDotDotDashed syms

    Things not done

      I may have promised to add dashed, dotted etc. options to @Tbl's
	rules, but existing code does not lend itself to it, so I haven't.

Changes and new features introduced in Version 3.30 [October 2004]

   Bug fixes (H. K. Man's fix for PDF links, '' in Python, crashing
     for some cases of "lout --option{value}")
   Fixed bug with large page sizes.  Lout stores object sizes in 32-bit
     integers, but smaller numbers (gap widths, shifts, character metrics
     etc.) in 16-bit integers.  The left parameter of @Wide and @High was
     erroneously being passed through a 16-bit variable.
   Added A2 to list of page types (it works, too)

   Kerning now tries original characters before their unaccented versions
   "@Graph style { grid }" replaces ticks in graphs with grid lines

   Things not done

      @CaptionGap not implementable since some gaps between figures and
	captions are not accessible.  Try @FigureCaptionFormat.
      Brazilian Portuguese declined on the grounds that it turned out
        virtually identical to Portuguese Portuguese (convince me...)
      I may have promised to add an "incontents" option to large-scale
        structure symbols, which would allow them to opt out of the table
	of contents.  On second thoughts I'm unwilling to do this.  I need
	to be convinced that Lout should encourage this strange thing.

Changes and new features introduced in Version 3.31 [August 2005]

   Bug fixes:
     Ludovic Courtes's fix for ligatures problem
     Kingston and Piotrowski's fix for list number referencing problem

     New @Diag link shapes symbols now visible as they should be
     Better handling of ellipsis (...) and similar tokens in Python

     crash my printer (but fine with kghostview, evince, ps2pdf etc.)
   Precedences and associativities now specifiable by invoking a macro
   New @ColouredUnderline symbol makes coloured underlines
   New "arrowstyle { many }" in @Diag makes "many"-relation arrowheads

      @Figure PageFoot location (reported by Summerfield) fixed

   Inclusion of EPS files with previews now supported (Bader)
   @TitleOf symbol now returns figure captions as well as chapter titles
   Hyphenation on in programming languages, using new "Programming @Language"
   New @DocInfo symbol (see User's Guide, Section 3.7)
   @Math symbol (Courtes) has now replaced @Eq in User's Guide; @Eq is
     still available for backward compatibility

   I had one report that prg2lout was returning non-zero intermittently
   during the formatting of the User's Guide.  I have not observed this
   myself.  Presumably there is an uninitialized variable somewhere.
   It's hard to do anything about this unless someone can get a core
   dump so we can find out where in prg2lout.c the crash occurred.

   Cichelli and Bader offered a patch to include PDF files by calling
   a freeware program to convert them to EPS files and including the
   EPS files.  I declined to include this in the standard release
   because I felt that it could be done outside Lout, and because the
   PDF support in Lout is not maintained and generally deprecated.

   Strictly speaking, turning hyphenation on in programming languages
   is not backward compatible.  I've done it because I have not been
   able to think of a case where it would cause trouble.  If you find
   a problem with it, please let me know.

Changes and new features introduced in Version 3.38 [October 2008]

   Bug fixes:
     Fixed my bungled installation of Bader's patch allowing EPS previews
     Fiddled with prg2lout.c hoping to fix its intermittent crash bug
   Converted "non-zero exit status of filter" from a fatal error to a
     warning, so the unfixed prg2lout error has fewer repercussions

Changes and new features introduced in Version 3.39 [September 2010]

   Bug fixes:
     Fixed a problem with @IndexBText
   Added copyright notices to many files, to satisfy the Savannah
     people.  There is no change in what is permitted.  Files that
     go to make up an output file are either public domain or else
     carry this additional wording, supplied by the Savannah people:
     "As a special exception, when this file is read by Lout when
     processing a Lout source document, you may use the result
     without restriction."

   Things not done

   It was suggested that using a version control system (in
     particular, svn) would be a good idea.  I thought about
     it but decided that there was too little change going on
     to make it worth my while, at the moment anyway.
